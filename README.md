# LEARN_reactjs: Learning react (via Team Treehouse projects)



This repository serves as an archive of small practice projects and exercises completed in **2020** as part of my initial learning journey with React.js, primarily through **Team Treehouse courses**.

The code in these projects reflects React's patterns and ecosystem from that time and may contain outdated dependencies or practices. This collection is maintained for historical reference and to document my foundational steps in learning React.

## Projects Overview

Each project resides in its own subdirectory, named after the core concept or practice it focused on. To run any of these projects:

1.  Navigate into the desired project's directory (e.g., `cd errorhandling`).
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install` if `yarn.lock` is present).
3.  Start the development server: `npm start` (or `yarn start`).

Here's a brief look at each project:

* ### `errorhandling/`
    Focused on implementing **Error Boundaries** in React to gracefully handle runtime errors in components.

* ### `newreturntypes/`
    Explored **new React return types** and features introduced around React v16, such as returning arrays and strings from `render` methods.

* ### `practice-router/`
    A practice application demonstrating client-side routing using **React Router**, including basic navigation and dynamic routes.

* ### `practice-scoreboard/`
    A simple **scoreboard application** to practice state management, component lifecycle, and basic event handling in React.

* ### `practice-search/`
    Focused on building a basic **search functionality** in a React application, covering controlled components and filtering data.

## Important Notes:

* **Technology:** These projects were built with React v16.x (or earlier) and associated tools available in 2020.
* **Dependencies:** Running `npm install` may result in warnings or errors due to outdated packages. These are not actively maintained.
* **Purpose:** This repository is primarily an educational artifact and is not intended for active development or production use.
